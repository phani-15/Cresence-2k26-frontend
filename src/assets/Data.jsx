In the first round, participants solve a crossword puzzle where each correct answer unlocks parts of a hidden logo. Once the full logo is revealed, they receive a three-digit code to enter the second round. The second round is a maze with three checkpoints, where participants must answer questions correctly to find numbers behind doors. If the number matches a digit from their code, they move to the next checkpoint. After the maze, the remaining participants enter the third and final round, where they are given a single challenging question. The first team to solve it correctly wins the event.",

Transform a crying emoji into a smiling one by successfully solving all three rounds.\n\n Event Description: \n\n1. Logic Patch – Given an incomplete emoji-based code with missing logic represented by question marks (?), participants must analyze the structure, identify the missing logic, and complete the program correctly.\nEx: 🤔(🔢%❓== 0 ) 👉🏼 ✍🏼('Even');\nValue:❓- 2  \n \n2. Emoji Decription – Participants receive a program written entirely in emojis. Their challenge is to interpret the meaning and translate it into a valid programming language (C, C++, Java, or Python). To proceed, they must ensure all test cases pass successfully. \nEx: 🤔(🔢% 2 == 0)\nProgram: If( a % 2 == 0 )\n\n3. CodeUnreal – Participants must carefully analyze its execution step by step and accurately determine the final output. Precision and attention to detail are key\nEx :📌 Even(🔢): 
        🤔(🔢 % 2 == 0 ) 👉🏼 ↩ 🔢
      ✍🏼 Even(2)\nOutput : 2  \n\nBy solving all three rounds, participants symbolically turn the sad emoji into a happy one, proving their programming expertise in a fun and innovative way.
